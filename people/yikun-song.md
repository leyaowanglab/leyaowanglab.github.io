### Introduction

As a doctoral student of Westlake-SMART PhD Program in 2025, I have chosen to conduct my first rotation in Leyao Lab. During my masterâ€™s study, I focused on the gut microbiome, mainly investigating the function and mechanism of Limosilactobacillus fermentum in weight loss. In Leyao Lab, I will continue my research on human health issues, utilizing organoids as a model to investigate the interactions between host, microbe and pathogens.
