**Introduction**:  

I am a medical student in the field of Public Health. During my master's thesis work I studied the epidemiology of SARS-CoV-2, integrating perspectives from virology and molecular biology. I am now expanding my interest in microbiomics and Host-Microbe-Pathogen interactions, particularly in relation to human health. In the Leyao Lab, I am integrating epidemiology, organoid models, and computational approaches to study the transmission patterns of mother-to-child microbiota and to explore maternal microbial interventions aimed at preventing or delaying the onset and progression of children diseases.
