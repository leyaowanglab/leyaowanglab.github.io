## Abstract

Prenatal adverse exposures have been associated with increased risks of development of respiratory diseases in children. The infant nasal microbiome is an important mechanism and indicator.

Our aim was to characterize and compare the nasal microbiome of infants who were in utero and exposed to Hurricane Maria in Puerto Rico during 2017 with that of infants who were conceived at least 5 months after the hurricane as controls.

We recruited 63 vaginally born infants, 29 of whom were in the exposure group and 34 of whom were in the control group. Nasal swab samples were collected and analyzed by using 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing at the community and taxon levels, respectively.
