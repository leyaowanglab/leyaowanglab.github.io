## Abstract

The mechanisms linking breast-feeding and childhood respiratory health remain obscure. Insights into the underlying pathways may contribute to better strategies for early disease prevention and therapy. In the current issue, Rosas-Salazar et al1 attempt to connect the dots by bringing the human microbiome into this paradigm.
