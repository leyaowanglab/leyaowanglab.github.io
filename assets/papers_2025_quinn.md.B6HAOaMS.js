We recruited 95 mother-newborn dyads from 3 sites (St Louis, Mo; San Juan, Puerto Rico; and Accra, Ghana) and collected samples at 2 time points (at the infants' birth and when they were around 2 months old). We performed analyses of 16S ribosomal RNA gene sequencing data to evaluate the maternal microbiomes (nasal, saliva, breast milk, and areola skin) as sources seeding the infant nasal microbiome.",-1),m=e("p",null,"Results: The infant nasal microbiome underwent a major compositional change during the first 2 months of life. The maternal nasal microbiome was identified as the primary source of bacteria in the early nasal microbiome across the 3 study regions.

A large portion of transmitted bacteria from the maternal nasal microbiome belonged to the generally beneficial bacterial genus Corynebacterium.
